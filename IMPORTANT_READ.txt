2 versions of the game exist.

Running "Main.java" in the engine folder will run the "GameEngine.java" class in the "FunctionalTextGame" folder. This is the normal text version of
the game. It does not include any GUI implementation or code, and is the correct version to run if testing the game engine, as it functions correctly
due to buggy GUI code not being included.

Running "RunGame.java" in the gui folder will run the "GameGUI.java" class in the same folder. This will use the "GameEngine.java" class in the engine
folder to run the GUI version of the game. It does not contain the normal game engine implementation, as this "GameEngine" class is programmed
differently from the "GameEngine" class that the text version uses.
